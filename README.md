# dt.ts

The [dt](https://dt.plumbing) programming language, implemented in TypeScript.

## Installation

This version expects to be installed and run with [bun](https://bun.sh)

```console
$ bun add -g @booniepepper/dt.ts
```

## Usage

```console
$ dt.ts 1 2 +
```

## Etc

This is not the canonical or reference implementation of dt. It's intended to
make fiddling with the language implementation easier and faster, but may
contain undocumented quirks due to the usage of JS and especially its `Number`
implementation.
